# AVE-PM: An Audio-visual Event Localization Dataset for Portrait Mode Short Videos

This repository contains the code and dataset for our NeurIPS 2025 submission on audio-visual event localization in portrait mode short videos.

## Overview

AVE-PM is the first dataset specifically designed for audio-visual event localization in portrait mode short videos. It contains 25,335 clips spanning 86 fine-grained categories with frame-level annotations and sample-level labels indicating background music (BGM) presence.

## Key Features
